# This is the directory for keeping all pickled objects.
- Pickled objects should be created using joblib package.
- Pickled objects should be stored in this directory with *\*.pkl* extension.
- *\*.pkl* extensions are ignored for GIT commit, 
  so *\*.ipynb* files will need to be run to re-generate all pickle files.
